vinegar-rinse-white-hair-natural-handmade-glass-bottle-250ml-118011145,"Vinegar Rinse, White Hair, Natural/Handmade, Glass Bottle, 250ml","<p>This is a vinegar rinse made from natural apple cider vinegar and a combination of herbs and essential oils to help brighten white and light blonde hair. It contains blue malva flower and lemon to cleanse your hair and remove yellow tones and restore your natural brightness. Spray in your hair after washing and distribute. 10-20 pumps are enough depending on the thickness and length of your hair. Leave in for 5 minutes and then rinse properly with warm water. You may still have a slight vinegar smell but it should disappear quickly. Vinegar detangles, increases shine, decreases build up and also adds body and definition to natural curls. It also stimulates the scalp and decreases dandruff and flaking. Please keep out of eyes! Please shake before use!<br>

It is presented in a stylish 250ml glass jar with an aluminium lid, a plastic free alternative. You can also buy a funky soap pump separately and reuse to avoid plastic waste.<br>



</p><p>THE BENEFITS OF APPLE CIDER VINEGAR:<br>
DETANGLES AND REDUCE FRIZZ: The outer layer of hair, the cuticle, covers the hair shaft and protects it like the bark on a tree. The cuticle is made of overlapping layers of long scales that lie along the surface of the hair. Apple cider vinegar helps smooth the cuticle which allows knots and tangles to comb out more easily. Frizzy hair is caused by lifted, open cuticles. Apple cider vinegar helps smooth and tighten cuticles to help decrease the frizz<br>
INCREASE SHINE: When the cuticle is in a good shape, is unbroken, and lies flat , your hair has a smooth appearance. When the laters of the cuticle are tightly knit together, the light is able to reflect off the cuticle. This is what makes hair shine.<br>
DECREASE BUILD-UP: Acv removes build up and residue from hair shaft to cleanse and clarify the hair and scalp without stripping the hairs natural oils balancing the ph on your scalp.<br>
DEFINE NATURAL CURLS: Unlike conventional conditioners, vinegar does not weigh down the individual hair strands which can cause hair to feel heavy and look limp. Also, by taming the frizz and removing residue, the vinegar rinses help add body to all hair types and renew the bounce to naturally curly hairs.<br>
STIMULATES HAIR GROWTH: Acv has a tonic action that promotes blood circulation in the small capillaries that irrigate the scalp with essential nutrients. This helps encourage hair growth and strengthens the roots.<br>
DECREASES DANDRUFF AND FLAKING: Acv has natural antibacterial and anti-fungal properties that help treat a dry itchy scalp by killing the bacteria and fungus that many be associated with dandruff (and even hair loss) and other scalp conditions without harsh chemicals.<br>

Treat your hair to a handcrafted shampoo bar that not only cleanses, but also nourishes and softens as you lather. Most commercial shampoos contain harsh synthetics that âcleanseâ by stripping your hair of everything, including natural oils. That not only leaves your hair dry and unmanageable, but also dull-looking. This natural shampoo bar is created with hair-loving ingredients, turning an ordinary routine into an indulgent experience, and leaving your hair nourished and naturally beautiful! It can also be used as a bath soap.To ensure the long life of your soap, store the bar in a cool place, out of direct sunlight until youâre ready to use it. In your shower, store the bar away from the direct water stream, and out of any standing water.To get a good lather, swipe the soap bar across your wet hair a few times and lather and scrub. Then rinse.Ingredients: saponified distilled water, coconut oil, palm oil (organic & sustainably harvested), castor oil, avocado oil, organic jojoba oil, organic cocoa butter, organic shea butter, wheat germ oil, organic argan oil, essential oils***************************Other shampoo bars you may like -***************************TESTIMONIALS for my Shampoo BarsThis is the first time using a shampoo bar and I'm pretty impressed.
